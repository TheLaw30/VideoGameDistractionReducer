    <p1>The New Principal
        Macy and her family had a great time at the
        school fair. There were games, cotton candy,
        and even a dunk tank.
        The fair had prizes, and Macy won the best
        prize. She got to be the principal for a day!
        On Monday morning, Macy’s principal let her sit
        in the principal’s chair at her big desk. Macy
        spun around on the chair. This was fun already.
       
        Next, she made her first announcement. All
        students could chew gum in class!
        Macy walked around the school. She stopped in
        to play with the kindergarten students. She
        listened to a story with the Grade 1 class. There
        were kids in the gym playing dodgeball, so she
        joined their game. The morning flew by!
        When it was time for recess, Macy made her
        next big announcement. She told everyone that
        recess would be an extra ten minutes! She
        could hear all the kids cheering.
        In the afternoon, Macy played on
        the principal’s computer.
        She learned how to use
        the photocopier. She
        sat at the big desk and
        drew pictures.
       
        At the end of the day, Macy made her last
        announcement. She was sure this one would
        make all the kids happy.
        “Attention, students! This is your principal, Macy.
        I am happy to tell you that there will be no
        homework for anyone today!”
        Cheering and laughter came from the
        classrooms. Being the principal was so much
        fun!
