    <h1>Jack wants to build a birdhouse.
        He gets some wood.
        He gets some nails
        and paint.
        His mom helps too.
        She gets a saw and a hammer.
        She gets a pencil and ruler.
        Jack draws his birdhouse. They build it together.
        Then they hang it up in a tree.
        A bird goes into the bird house.
        A second bird goes in. A third bird goes in.
        A fourth bird goes in!
        Jack and his mom look at each other.
        They need a bigger birdhouse!
